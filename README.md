# rock-paper-scissors
A simple console based rock paper scissors game where the User can play against the Computer. A graphical user interface will be added soon. This is The Odin Projects Rock Paper Scissors Project! https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors 

I learned a lot about parameters, conditionals, comparison and logical operators and functions!
