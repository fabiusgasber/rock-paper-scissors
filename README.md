# rock-paper-scissors
A simple rock paper scissors game where the User can play against the Computer via a graphical user interface. This is The Odin Projects Rock Paper Scissors Project! https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors 

I learned a lot about parameters, conditionals, comparisons, logical operators, functions, event handling and DOM manipulation!
